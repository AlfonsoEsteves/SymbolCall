Should cards have their own hand score?
  After all, all cards are supposed to be equally good.
  So if a card sucks in the hand, then it has to be really good an the field to compensate.
  And that would stimulate its invocation.
  
Yes, they should.

Imagine 2 cards:
  A really strong on the field. Hard to invoke
  B really strong on the field. Easier to invoke. Really bad on the hand.
  
Let's say that both have the same field score (they are equally good)
Let's say I have to choose between invoking one or the other.
If I give them the same score, I wouldn't be stimulating removing B from the hand.
