It want the games to be relatively turnaroundable.

To avoid accumulating too much power, I could cap the amount of cards in the field to 5.

Also note that a lot of cards on the field, can make it hard to keep track of all the passive effects
  Although that could be said of the hand too.

Another thing that I could do is give the loosing players an extra drawn card (only one per turn).
The extra card will have a health cost, and it will be very small if he is loosing bad.

  I have to be carful though.
  If I do it based on the field cards difference, it could overpower hand cards and spendable cards.
  If I do it based on both, it could still overpower spendable cards.

  If he has X cards less on the field, the extra draw will cost him Y.
  For instance:
    1 card less => 16
    2 card less => 8
    3 card less => 4
    4 card less => 2
    5 card less => 1
 
  I really dislike this idea, though. It it a weird rule.

Another option is that each card looses 1 point of health each turn.
  I like this very much either...
