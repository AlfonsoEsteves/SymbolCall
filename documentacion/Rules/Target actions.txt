What actions will have targets?

Some actions can be super strong if you can pick the target.
  For instance the invoke action.

If I make the effect that invokes a target hard enough to pull off, everything will be ok (balanced)
But the effects have to be passive, not active.

Will passive effects have targets?
Yes, but there is something I need to decide:
If in my turn I trigger one of my opponents cards, who will select the target when a target-action gets executed?
2 options:
  Card owner: this can make the flow of the game "choppy", but is the traditional way in TCG.
  Turn owner: this will be counter intuitive for some TGC players, but I think it is simpler (I play on my turn, you play in yout turn, and that is it).
I like more the second. For me it is important to make games quick and not too brain-expensive.
If I make the turn change constantly between players it can make things more confusing, because it messes a little with the idea of turn.
  And it can also make the game more tiresome for the player. I think it is easy to plan your moves once and execute, than deciding multiple times what you are going to do each time the decision duty is given to you.
