What actions will have targets?

Some actions can be super strong if you can pick the target.
  For instance the invoke action.

If I make the effect that invokes a target hard enough to pull off, everything will be ok (balanced)
But the effects have to be passive, not active.

Will passive effects have targets?

The issue with this is that the player may need to take a decision in his opponent's turn.
That can be confusing for the player.

The adventage is that it adds new possibilities. And allows me to balance overpowered target-actions.

What zone/player will the player choose from?

The obious options are:
attack: rival's field
discard: rival's hand
invoke: my own hand

withdraw will often be useful for both purposes
  - withdraw an opponent's card that is strong and hard-to-invoke
  - withdraw my own card that is about to die, or could interrupt a sequence that I want to execute

although rare
  you could still want to attack or discard your own cards
    to avoid the execution of a passive
  you could want to invoke an opponent's card
    to invoke a hand ritual for instance
