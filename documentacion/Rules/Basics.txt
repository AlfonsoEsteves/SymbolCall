Cards can have multiple effects.

An effect can be a hand effect, or a field effect.
  A hand effect can be executed only if the card is in the hand.
  A field effect can be executed only if the card is in the field.

Besides that, effects can also be classified as active or passive effects.

Active effects can be executed (activated) during the turn of the owner of the card.
  Only one active effect can be activated per turn, for each card.
Passive effects are executed (triggered) when a specific sequence of symbols is called.

There is an execution stack.
  If an effect triggers another, then its execution gets paused (and later resumed).

The actions are:
  call call (essence)
  atta attack (amount) (target)
  invo invoke (target)
  with withdraw (target)
  disc discard (target)

The targets are:
  ow owner
  op opponent
  tr trigger
  ch choose
  sl self
