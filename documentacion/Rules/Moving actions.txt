The actions that can move a card are:
withdraw
invoke
discard
attack

withdraw is analogous to invoke
  both send a card to the hand/field, regardless of where it is

discard is analogous to attack
  both send a card to the deck, if they are in the hand/field

This way the field and the hand will be almost symmetrical.
The only diffecences being:
 - drawn cards go to the hand
 - you can't directely destroy a field card, you need to remove all its health point

I almost made discard similar to withdraw and invoke
  It would destroy the card regardless of where it is.
  But that would be too overpower against strong hard-to-invoke field cards.
  Imaging putting a passive effect that discards its trigger.
