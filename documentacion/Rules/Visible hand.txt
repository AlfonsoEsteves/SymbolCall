I like the idea of the hand NOT being visible.
Because:
  it will be more familiar to TCG players
  it makes it easier for the player, because he doesn't have to keep up with all of the passive effects
    (the effects, would still be executed, but it is not his responsability to be aware of them)
  it makes the game more interesting
    not knowing exactly what your rival is gonna do
      for instance, when your rival invokes a really strong card
    to decide if you want to show a card, or keep it secret

At first, the thing that I did not like about it is that there will be
  passive effects that will be triggered without the player foreseeing it

But now that I think about it, it is a very interesting feature.
  It really brings back the feeling of trap cards.
(The card will be shown when it gets triggered, at least for an instant)

Will the revealed cards stay visible?
Will withdrawn cards stay revealed?
  I guess, yes and yes

Note that this affects a lot the effects that discard a target card.
Regardless of whether there are some visibles or not, the player could still know that the (right/left) most cards in his opponent hands are older and probably harder to invoke

Should I show all the opponent's cards when a choose-discard action is executed?
I believe not, for 2 reasons:
  it is more simple not to do it
  it makes the discard choose effect less overpowerd
Discard choose effect could end up being very opponent dependant, though.
Now that I think about this again,
  I think yes, I should reveal all the hand and keep it revealed.
  First of all, discard is not that overpowerful. Hands tend to accumulate cards that are hard to invoke
    and it will probably not be critical get rid of them.
    (mmm, this can be OP agains decks like the 3 towers)
