GOOD

Acquiring and having rare cards
Invoking strong cards that are hard to invoke
Fucking up with your opponent's strategy
To only make meaningful decisions
The drawing is the only random part
When your opponent reaches a point of strength, but you (with wit and luck) turn the situation around
  Most bad situations are turn-aroundable with wit and luck
  The game outcome shouldn't be decided in the first turns.
The strong cards are the minority in the universe of cards.
  And they are also the minority in decks.
A lot of functionally different cards.
Defeating Goliath.
  
BAD

Strong cards dying easily
Useless cards
  Shadow cards
Overpowered cards
Meaningless decisions
When a player gets the adventage quickly and it is impossible to turn the situation around
Rebuild the deck to face a specific opponent.
