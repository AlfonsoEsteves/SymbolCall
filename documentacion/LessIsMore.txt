The less effects a card has, the easier it is to understand and remember it.
Similar to the actions in an effect.

Besides the less actions and effects getting executed, the easier it is to keep track.

So I should try not to add unnecesary or irrelevant effects or actions.
  Like actions that do 1 damage.
