Should bosses share cards?
Should bosses use player cards?

The adventage of sharing is that the player has to learn about less cards.

So the idea is that bosses will have some unique cards, that they do not share with the other bosses, nor with the player.
And the rest will be player cards.

The player cards will also increase in strength as the bosses levels up.

Should the bosses card be stronger?

Yes.
Sinse the boss's player cards will also level up, it is not really necessary.
But if I do it the right way, it can give a David vs Goliath feeling.

For instance, compare these two scenarios:
1) The boss cards are 5% stronger
2) The boss has 80% of player cards, and 20% of cards that are 25% stronger.
The second scenario gives a stronger feeling of David vs Goliath.

How much stronger should be the computer cards?

The increment in strength shouldn't be too big and the porcentage of computer cards in the hand shouldn't be to low.
Otherwise, the computer performance will vary a lot depending on the cards it draws.
This could persuade the player to quit and restart games fast, waiting for the computer to draw a bad hand.

A reasonable amount could be:
  66.6% of the boss cards are player cards
  33.3% of the boss cards are 20% stronger
  On average, the boss would have cards 6.6% stronger

Having 33% of forbidden cards will make the computer draw them quite frequently.
  More than 33% of forbidden cards will make them look not rare. 
  That can decrase the feeling of David vs Goliath, even though the boss would be stronger.
A 20% strength increment, may be very important to myself, but the player may not even notice it at all.

Note that the boss has an extra adventage at the start of the game:
  It has a balanced deck, while the player doesn't.
