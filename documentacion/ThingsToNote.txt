Hard sequences do not become useless against a good AI (or human player)
  because, even if they are never triggered, they can restrict a lot the options of the rival.

Hard to invoke cards that call symbols once they are in the field are vulnerable to withdraws.

Passive invocation doesn't make a card lose its turn.

When the order of actions matter:
  call-call   yes
  call-other  yes
  other-other no         mmm how about damaging and invoking??
