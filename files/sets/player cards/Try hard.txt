description:
If this card has enough life, it can cause a lot of damage. It will end up low in health, though.
If it is low in health, it can be destroyed and withdrawn from the deck.
It has a powerful passive damage effect. If you can can trigger the effect often, then you may want to use this card defensively.
In other words, you wouldn't use its effect if it is full health. Only to retreat it.
